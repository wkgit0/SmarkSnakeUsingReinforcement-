About:
This project report presents a Snake game AI developed using Q-Learning and the Bellman equation. The AI agent learns optimal strategies by navigating the game environment, collecting food, and avoiding collisions. The Q-Learning algorithm updates action values with the Bellman equation, striking a balance between immediate rewards and future potential gains. The agent's performance evolves through episodes of training, demonstrated by learning curves and gameplay videos. The project showcases the successful application of reinforcement learning to teach an AI agent complex gameplay, exemplifying its potential in diverse problem domains. Future work could involve refining parameters and exploring advanced learning techniques.
